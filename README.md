# Phyzician-Teleconsultation-Android-Mobile-Application

## Problem Statement
<p align = "justify">
The purpose of phyzician is to automate the existing manual system with the help of computer software and technologies. The primary goal is to keep track of doctor, appointment, patient, booking, and doctor schedule
information. It keeps track of all doctor-related information, such as fees and schedules. <b> This project aims to create application software that will decrease the amount of manual effort involved in maintaining
Doctors, Appointments, Doctor Fees, and Patients.</b> <br/>

One of the essential uses in telemedicine is teleconsultation, a method of communication over networks. Videoconferencing technology is used in real-time consultations, allowing medical specialists and clients
to connect. Both sites must interact and change photos and documents in real-time throughout the consultation. <br/>

Teleconsultation, which uses electronic information and communication technology, can provide a cost-effective healthcare approach used in clinics. A teleconsultation is a valuable tool for remote
consultations and discussion conferences. Teleconsultation can increase accessibility and quality of treatment and reduce expenses. The main
functions of the teleconsultation that are considered under a single application include:<br/><br/>
<b>❖ Doctors and Patient Login <br/>
❖ Appointment Booking & Cancellation <br/>
❖ In-app Prescription Form <br/>
❖ Chat with Doctors <br/>
❖ Health Tracker<br/>
❖ Admin Accessibility
</b> <br/>

### Overview: <br/>
<p align = "justify">
1. This app provides role-based login features for Admins, patients, and doctors. <br/>
2. Admins accounts will be created from the backend (i.e., generated by developers). One admin can
add multiple doctors in an application, record booking and cancelled appointments, manage the
payment status, and view chat details.<br/>
3. Further, Doctors can login, change passwords, update their details, edit their appointment slots,
and add prescriptions.<br/>
4. Patients can login with a phone number. They can view all doctor's and doctor's details based on
specialization, edit and book appointments, and download current and all previous prescriptions.<br/>
5. Patients can chat with doctors after booking an appointment, share images and video call links.<br/> 
6. Phyzician contains a feature Phyzihealth Health tracker, which will record all the basic patient
details, for example Body mass index, blood pressure, step count, and menstrual cycle.<br/> 
</p>

### Stakeholders
<p>
1. <b> Administration </b> - Admin refers to the main head component of the application, which is an interface between the doctor and the patient.<br/>
2. <b> Doctors  </b> - The doctor is one of the application's stakeholders. The doctor has to set up their profile, choose the slots, check appointments and chat with the patients.<br/>
3. <b> Patients  </b> - The patient is one of the application's stakeholders. Any patient willing for a teleconsultation can log in to our application using its mobile number and can choose the doctor from the available speciality then, book an appointment from the open visiting hours of the doctor.<br/>
